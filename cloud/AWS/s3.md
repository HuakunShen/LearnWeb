# Amazon S3

S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage. Its alternatives are

- [GCP Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Azure Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/storage/blobs/)

It can be used to store massive amount of files such as images and videos at a very low price. Different types of storage are supported based on access frequency. Infrequent accessed file types such as archives have very low price.

## Custom Domain

See [Cloudfront](./Cloudfront.md) about how to set up custom domain.

## Restricted Access

AWS has private access permission by default, but there are scenarios where public access is required for use cases such as displaying images on web pages.

Sometimes you don't want to expose full public access, to external users. For example, paid services are only for subscribers.

There are 2 options with AWS CloudFront,

- Signed URls
- Signed Cookie

See [CloudFront](./CloudFront.md) for more details.
