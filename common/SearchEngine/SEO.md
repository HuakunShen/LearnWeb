# SEO: Search Engine Optimization
The goal of SEO is to create a strategy that will increase your rankings position in search engine results and get more traffic.

## Three Pillars of Optimization
1. Technical: Optimize for web crawlers
2. Creation: Content strategy to target specific keywords
3. Popularity: Make search engines believe your site is a trusted source through [backlinks](https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks), referenced from other websites.
## Four Main Responsibilities
1. **Crawling:** going through the web and parse contents in all websites.
2. **Indexing:** Store scraped data and index the data for quicker search time.
3. **Rendering:** Some websites may render pages with JavaScript. Search Engine might not render the page to collect data, thus client-side rendering isn't good for SEO.
4. **Ranking:** Query data based on user input. Rank the data returned for bettern user experience.

See [Googlebot](Googlebot.md) for how Goole crawls the web.
